# Employee-Attrition-project
The current economy is faced with a huge problem of job vacancies because a lot of people are quitting or changing companies. This can be hugely detrimental to companies as work gets delayed, training resources get lost, ultimately prolonging project completion. As a result, millions of dollars are spent on new recruitment processes, trainings, compensation and so much more. 
This project aims to address this issue by proactively giving stakeholders insights into the wellfare and prospects of their employees through the use of Data Analysis and machine learning. 

# Goal
Predict employees that are likely to quit so that companies can take remedial steps to keep employees and bolster their workforce without negatively affecting business productivity. 


# Result
## Exploratory Data Analysis
Based on the data exploration carried out, these points were noticed: 
1.) Employees that left the company had much lower average job satisfaction level as compared to people still in the company
2.) Employees that left had a slightly higher average monthly working hours than those retained. The data suggests that they left due to exhaustion
3.) Majority of employees that left earned low and medium salaries
4.) Majority of people that left the company are in their 3rd, 4th and 5th year.According to the data, employees that have spent more than 6 years in the company did not quit. In addition, employees in their 5th year are the most likely to quit. 
5.) Almost all the people that quit did not get any promotion in the last 5 years. In addition, all the people that got promoted did not quit
6.) Most of the departments have an attrition rate between 22-29%. The department with the least attrition rate is 'Management' with a rate of 14% while the department with the highest attrition rate is 'HR' at 29%.
## Prediction (Machine Learning) 
The employees with the following employee ID are most likely to quit next: 
2001	
14192	
14199	


# Recommendation
Based on the exploratory data analysis, I highly recommend that the stakeholders take the following steps: 
1.) Ensure that employees are not being overworked by tracking every employee's work hours and number of projects being worked on.
2.) Improve compensation amounts for low and medium earners by incorporating bonuses and incentives.
3.) Create an incentive program incorporating monetary benefits,  for employees particularly in their 5th year. In addition, they can add more challenging projects for 5th year employees to keep them motivated 
4.) Improve on work culture and incorporate promotions accordingly with every appraisal.
5.) Carry out further investigation into the HR department to determine the cause of the high rate or attrition and take remedial steps
