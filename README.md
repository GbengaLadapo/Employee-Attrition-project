# Employee-Attrition-project
The current economy is faced with a huge problem of job vacancies because a lot of people are quitting or changing companies. This can be hugely detrimental to companies as work gets delayed, training resources get lost, ultimately prolonging project completion. As a result, millions of dollars are spent on new recruitment processes, trainings, compensation and so much more. 
This project aims to address this issue by proactively giving stakeholders insights into the wellfare and prospects of their employees through the use of Data Analysis and machine learning. 

# Goal
Predict employees that are likely to quit so that companies can take remedial steps to keep employees and bolster their workforce without negatively affecting business productivity.
